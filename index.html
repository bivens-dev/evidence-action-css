        <p>
          An estimated 525,000 children under five die from diarrhea each year, often due to unsafe water. 
          Our chlorine dispensers are installed directly next to untreated water sources, allowing residents 
          to add a precise dose of diluted chlorine to their jerrican before filling it with water. 
          At a cost of less than $1.50 per person per year, Dispensers for Safe Water is an innovative 
          and cost-effective approach to the challenge of unsafe water in poor, rural areas.

          More than 835 million preschool- and school-age children are at risk of parasitic worm infection. 
          The Deworm the World Initiative partners with governments to develop and implement national, 
          school-based deworming programs. We have supported delivery of over 1.8 billion deworming treatments 
          since 2014 at an average cost of less than USD $0.50 per treatment, with measurable improvements 
          in health, economic, and educational outcomes.

          Our engine for new program development <em>the Accelerator</em> selects, optimizes, and scales interventions 
          that can measurably improve the lives of millions of people in the world's poorest places. Through a 
          rigorous process, interventions are evaluated so that only those with the greatest potential for 
          cost-effective impact are scaled up. Interventions like syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant 
          women, iron and acid supplementation, and in-line chlorination are being implemented and 
          tested through our Accelerator process.
