/* 
  Open Props is a project from one of the members of the 
  Google Chrome developer relations team that is conceptually 
  similar to Tailwind but has a slightly different focus on
  using CSS custom properties rather than CSS classes. Due to 
  that small change you end up picking up a lot of benefits at 
  both a performance and code maintanence level. Check out the 
  website at https://open-props.style/ to take a look at the docs.
  
  The following import is 4kB and gives us more than 500 tokens 
  covering things like colors, spacing, typography, shadows etc.. 
  Important to note that these are ONLY custom properties this import
  does not include any styles or classes to use so we are still starting
  with what is essentially a blank slate.

  Also if you haven't used layers before they help make simplify CSS 
  architecture quite a bit by providing a consistent order of precedence
  regardless of what order the browser parses the CSS.

  We can then create a baseline "Design System" to build on top of.
  This is where we would capture all of the shared styles essentially.

@import url(design-system.css) layer(design-system);

/* 
  Now we can create a series of component specific styles
