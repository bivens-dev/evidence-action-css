<!-- 

  NOTE: This page shows an alternative implementation using the browser's 
  built-in component model (Web Components). If you haven't used Web Components
  before it's actually a kind of large topic and depending on how you use 
  them can have some sharp edges. However, the approach shown here removes the 
  most common ones and in practice is almost identical both for the HTML and 
  the CSS. 

  This approach doesn't require any JavaScipt to display on any of our target 
  browsers except Firefox which still hasn't implemented the standard but as 
  you can see at the bottom of the page the polyfill is about as basic as it gets 
  and isn't really a factor.

  The other thing you will notice here is a 3 line bit of boilerplate that looks like:

  <template shadowrootmode="open">
    <slot></slot>
  </template>

  That is what allows us to opt-out of most of the sharp edges but also means we miss
  out on most of the benefits as well unfortunately making this approach a bit harder 
  to justify for components that don't actually need JavaScript at all. It would however 
  allow a consistent component model to be used across the entire website which might 
  have some appeal regardless of if the component required JavaScript functionality or not. 
  It's entirely up to you obviously I just wanted to show it as one potential path 
  you might want to consider.

  If you have 90 mins to kill and have a curiosity to learn more this is a decent on-ramp
  introduction to the topic that assumes no background knowledge but only if you feel 
  like it obviously ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq5oiHjwFxI

            An estimated 525,000 children under five die from diarrhea each year, often due to unsafe water. 
            Our chlorine dispensers are installed directly next to untreated water sources, allowing residents 
            to add a precise dose of diluted chlorine to their jerrican before filling it with water. 
            At a cost of less than $1.50 per person per year, Dispensers for Safe Water is an innovative 
            and cost-effective approach to the challenge of unsafe water in poor, rural areas.

            More than 835 million preschool- and school-age children are at risk of parasitic worm infection. 
            The Deworm the World Initiative partners with governments to develop and implement national, 
            school-based deworming programs. We have supported delivery of over 1.8 billion deworming treatments 
            since 2014 at an average cost of less than USD $0.50 per treatment, with measurable improvements 
            in health, economic, and educational outcomes.

            Our engine for new program development <em>the Accelerator</em> selects, optimizes, and scales interventions 
            that can measurably improve the lives of millions of people in the world's poorest places. Through a 
            rigorous process, interventions are evaluated so that only those with the greatest potential for 
            cost-effective impact are scaled up. Interventions like syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant 
            women, iron and acid supplementation, and in-line chlorination are being implemented and 
            tested through our Accelerator process.
